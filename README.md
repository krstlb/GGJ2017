## Installation
Latest version: `TsunamiSaviour-Beta0125.exe`

2. Extract the executables, Tobii.EyeX.Client.dll, and data folders to the same location.
3. Launch any of the release versions, depending on your hardware.

## Controls
For latest version only:
- E to toggle between input modes: EyeX or mouse
- Esc to quit
- Tobii EyeX is not required - there is a mouse input version as well. The eyetracker version should still be able to run, you just won't be able to control the waves.
